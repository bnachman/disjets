  DESY-HERA.  Normalized, differential cross-section measurements of the leading jet and electron in the lab frame in collisions between 27.6 GeV positrons and 920 GeV protons collected by the H1 detector in 2006 and 2007, totaling 136/pb. 

  The measurement fiducial region is defined as:
  - Q^2 > 150 GeV^2, 0.2 < y < 0.7, ptJet > 10 GeV.
  - Jets are clustered with the kT algorithm using R = 1 in the lab frame.

location: Correlation Matrix
description: Statistical correlation between bins.  This is calculated with bootstrapping and the neural networks are retrained each time and thus there is a small contribution also from the stochastic nature of the training procedure.  The bins are numbered 0 through 24 with the first 6 bins corresponding to the jet pT, the next 5 corresponding to the jet eta, the next 7 corresponding to delta phi and the last 7 corresonding to qT/Q.

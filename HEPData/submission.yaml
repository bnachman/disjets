  DESY-HERA.  Normalized, differential cross-section measurements of the leading jet and electron in the lab frame in collisions between 27.6 GeV positrons and 920 GeV protons collected by the H1 detector in 2006 and 2007, totaling 136/pb. 

  The measurement fiducial region is defined as:
  - Q^2 > 150 GeV^2, 0.2 < y < 0.7, ptJet > 10 GeV.
  - Jets are clustered with the kT algorithm using R = 1 in the lab frame.

- Unfold_Main.ipynb is used to derive the nominal result and most of the systematic uncertainties (including the non-closure uncertainty).
- SystematicUncertainties.ipynb processes the values from Unfold_Main.ipynb to make the uncertainty plots
- StatUncert_Bootstrapping.ipynb is for the stat uncert. and processes the output of a standalone script run_many.py which calls strap.py
- HadronizationCorrections.ipynb processes external outputs from Pythia and Herwig for the hadronization corrections

All of the unfolded (unbinned) results can be found on squirrel at /data1/users/bpnachman/H1/results/May31_2021
